## Kate Young

I'm a junior developer and [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) boot camp graduate. I'm an STEM educator and former headteacher who's changing career into tech. Why? Because I love working in creative and diverse teams to solve hard problems. Working with schools to improve student outcomes, I was faced time and again with challenges I knew could solve using technology, if only I knew how to code! I believe that technology can empower teachers to proved individualized learning tailored so each child can fulfil their potential. I want to be a part of making this a reality. Knowing I learn best as part of a team, I took the plunge and enrolled on an intensive coding boot camp. It's been humbling and inspiring to become a beginner again and to walk the growth mindset walk, and now I can't wait to get stuck into my first junior developer role. I'm also a mum who is passionate about advocating for inclusive workplaces that enable working parents and carers to thrive.

## Skills

#### Leading Learning

I'm a passionate and professional leader of learning:
- As a headteacher, I developed and implemented a custom [Cambridge Professional Development Qualification programme](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/support-and-training-for-schools/professional-development/professional-development-qualifications), resulting in a tangible and sustainable improvement in teaching standards. 
- As a trainee developer, I undertook a Heroku learning spike and shared this learning with colleagues via demonstrations, Trello cards and [blog posts](https://www.katemyoung.com/#Deploying%20an%20existing%20Rails%20app%20to%20Heroku). As a result, our whole team was able to deploy to Heroku and our final project was deployed early and often.
- I lead by example when it comes to demonstrating a growth mindset, sharing my coding mistakes via an [ErrorBlog](https://www.katemyoung.com/#ErrorBlog) and as a peer mentor at Makers Academy.

#### Collaborative Problem Solving

I'm highly skilled at working with others to solve complex business and coding problems:
- I led the development of Acacia International School, resulting in registration as a Cambridge International School, development of an [intergrated, custom curriculum](https://www.acaciaschool.com/academics/#primary) and improved stakeholder engagement.
- As director of [educational consultancy Sifunda](http://sifundalearning.org/what-we-do/training-development/), I worked with local government, business and NGOs to analyse development needs and implement bespoke solutions, including monitoring and evaluation for a [DFID funded literacy programe](https://www.happy-readers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sifunda-Midline-Evaluation-Report-HR-FINAL2.pdf).
- As a trainee developer at Makers Academy, I'm frequently brought in as a fresh pair of eyes when team members are blocked. For example, debugging an issue on an AirBnB clone where the database table had been updated, but the arguments passed to the method creating a new database record hadn't been updated. In our final Sweepstake Generator project, I debugged issues with handing the JSON returned from the API call and [storing the API key secretly](https://www.katemyoung.com/#Use%20the%20dotenv-rails%20gem%20to%20store%20API%20keys).
